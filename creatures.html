	<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#fa0300">The berserker armour is a cursed set of heavy iron that protects the wearer from heavy damage. It increases you pain tolerance immensly, not making it unnoticeable but ignorable. It also closes wounds and mends bones during fighting by forcefully piercing them with spikes. The armour is incredibly powerful but it can and will kill the wearer. It is currently worn by Guts.</FONT>

A behelit always belongs to someone and sometimes those people don't even know. Their destiny is to use it and they will, usually bringing disaster. May God help you if someone close to you finds a small, crimson behelit attached to a necklace.</FONT>
