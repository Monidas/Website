	<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#fa0300">this is the website I made in honour of Kentaro Miura, writer of the fantastic series "Berserk". Kentaro Miura recently passed away on the 6th of May, 2021. Berserk is a long running comic series serialised in Japan featuring Guts and his story. It is a somber yet action-packed journey and is in my eyes one of the best stories to have ever been written.</FONT>

	<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#fa0300">I decided to write about this topic as I only recently discovered and read Berserk. It was such a fun experience though it's a very dark story. The characters, world and art are all phenomonal and it is highly rated. However, not much people know what it is and so I wanted to spread awareness.
